> ### About the User:


Hi, I am Vinit MP working at Peppermint Robotics.
Most of my work I do using this account is private.
Initially I have worked in the Telematics Project, where I was involved in creating UI for the telematics website.

> I further progressed into Peppermint RemoteControl project, where I had to create a Remote control to move the robot and display the robot params of the connected robot.
